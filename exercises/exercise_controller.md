## Exercise: A Controller class

Examine the accompanying class in [Controller.h](Controller.h) and [Controller.cpp](Controller.cpp).

* Discuss with your partner where the DRY principle is violated
* What test cases would you write?
* How can you test the dependency to global state simulated with the call to `rand()`?
* Can you refactor away the loops by corresponding standard algorithms?
* What other improvements can you think of?

Note: This exercise was derived from a concrete code example and changed to protect the guilty.
